## How can I present

We'd love to hear from you if you are keen to share something with the community.  Topics are not exclusive to SAP related stuff, but extend to any of the cool things you may be working on or have worked on and want to share.  

If we love your request, we'll get back in touch with you to arrange speaking at one of the future sessions we will arrange.  Remember there are no barriers to entry, except yourself from getting in touch with us.

Please submit your proposal [here](https://forms.gle/NMY31ips5KwqM8c97) before the 1st of May 2020. That gives us a chance to work out a calendar for our [May 2020 Event](/may-2020-event).

## What do I need to present

You might think that you need a semi professional setup to do a session. Trust us you really donâ€™t. A computer, headset and an internet connection is enough. You can also chose whether or not you want to use Webcam. This is entirely up to you. No pressure from our side. We really just appreciate your contribution.

Please also make sure to read and familiarise yourself with our [Code of Conduct Policy](/code-of-conduct)
