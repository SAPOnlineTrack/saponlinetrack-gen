## Get in touch with us

We'd love to hear from you if you are keen to share something with the community.  Topics are not exclusive to SAP related stuff, but extend to any of the cool things you may be working on or have worked on and want to share.  

If we love your request, we'll get back in touch with you to arrange speaking at one of the future sessions we will arrange.  Remember there are no barriers to entry, except yourself from getting in touch with us.

## What we want

At this stage hold tight whilst we work out some details and setup the process to register your submission
