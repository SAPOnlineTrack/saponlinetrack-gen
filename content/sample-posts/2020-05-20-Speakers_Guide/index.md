Some of you may already be familiar with public speaking and streaming.  However for those who are less so  we compiled a little bit of information to help you out and hopefully help you to produce some amazing content for your session.

## Feedback

Try recording your own session and watching it back so you experience it from the perspective of a viewer.  I did this some time back and it was both informative and horrifying.  My technical knowledge of the subject was fine, but I needed to be far more animated, emotive, engaging.  

As an alternative to recording, try presenting to friends or relatives.  Remember you're not necessarily looking for feedback on your subject matter.

## Find your style

It's important to find your presentation style.  

## Less Text More Action

Having a slide deck that complements your spoken content is key to effective presenting.  There is nothing worse than having a text heavy presentation where the speaker is effectivly reading the slide back to you.

Check out this ted x post on [better slide deck content](https://blog.ted.com/10-tips-for-better-slide-decks/).

We highly recommend you take a look at [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) for generating your presentation content.
